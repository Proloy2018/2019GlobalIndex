# SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019
## SDG Transformations
Country-level data from 2019 Index and Dashboards

## Project History
Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by all member states of the United-Nations in 2015, describe a universal agenda that applies to and must be implemented by all countries. Sound metrics and data are critical for turning the SDGs into practical tools for problem solving.

The SDG Index and Dashboards Report is the first worldwide study to assess where each country stands with regard to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Unlike its predecessor the Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs set standards not only for emerging and developing countries, but also for the industrialized nations. Governments and civil society alike can utilize the SDG Index and Dashboards Report to identify priorities for action, understand key implementation challenges, track progress, ensure accountability, and identify gaps that must be closed in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

The report is co-produced every year since 2016 by the [Bertelsmann Stiftung](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/de/startseite/) and the [Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)](http://unsdsn.org/). It is a complement to the official SDG indicators and voluntary country-led review processes. The report is not an official monitoring tool. It uses publicly available data published by official data providers (World Bank, WHO, ILO, others) and other organizations including research centers and non-governmental organizations.

## Report Description
This report is the fourth edition of the annual overview of countries’ performance on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals prepared jointly by the Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN). The Report covers all 193 UN member states and presents data on changes over time in SDG indicators, as well as calculations for trajectories until 2030.
